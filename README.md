# Data_Mining_Final_Project_DS634
In this project I have done binary classification on Cardiovescular dataset to predict whether a patient has Cardiovescular disease or not.
I have compared KNN, LSTM, RandomForest for prediction and compared their results, the average accuracy for each model is around 72%
